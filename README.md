# decimal-to-binary-converter
A c++ function for converting decimal numbers to binary (as a string)
Created as an outline for a Scratch.mit.edu program that converts a given decimal age (int) to it's binary representation (string), and displays an array of 7 candles, represented as a 7 bit binary number, on a cake.

`src/binary.cpp` contains comments containing a text-based Scratch psuedocode, used for directly translating the code to Scratch. (Converting actual code or other pseudocode to Scratch is VERY frustrating so this makes the process much easier)
