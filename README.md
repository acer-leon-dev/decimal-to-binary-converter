# decimal-to-binary-converter
A C++ function for converting decimal numbers to binary (as a string)
Created as an outline for a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) program that converts a given decimal age (int) to it's binary representation (string), and displays an array of 7 candles, represented as a 7 bit binary number, on a cake.

[doc/binary_scratch.txt](doc/binary_scratch.txt) outlines a text-based Scratch psuedocode, used for directly translating the code to Scratch. (Converting actual code or other pseudocode to Scratch is VERY frustrating so this makes the process much easier and efficient)

Completed Scratch program: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1091261713/
